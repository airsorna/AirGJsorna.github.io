                   <p class="p-name">A reflection on Wardrip-Fruin, N. ‘What Hypertext Is'</p>
                   <p class="p-summary">-Summary</p>
                   <p>
                    What is hypertext? Our most respected scholars offer answers that span a wide range. In the literary community, the definitions offered often focus on the link. A number of well-known hypertext researchers from the University of Southampton argue link-based understandings miss "some of the more profound aspects of hypertext". Intellectual communities must be home to arguments over the definitions of key terms, as these are arguments about the meaning of the field.

                    But they must also be able to understand the history of our terms, so that we can see how competing definitions of the moment are movements in different directions from a common starting point. In the case of "hypertext" the term was coined by Theodor Holm ("Ted") Nelson. This paper examines two of Nelson's early publications of the term in order to provide a starting point for historically-informed definitions.
                   </p>
                   <p class="p-name">-Reflection</p>
                   <p>
                    According to Nelson's 1965 paper “A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate” a "hyperfilm" is a browsable or variable-sequenced film, not just another type of "hypertext". He defines hypertext as a body of written and pictorial content interconnected in such a complicated way that it cannot be expressed or depicted on paper in the same phrase. Two paragraphs later, he describes hyperfilm as "only one of the possible hypermedia that require our attention". Nelson's definition does not explicitly contradict definitions of hypertext that focus on the link, links are not mentioned. Both hypertext and hyperfilm are characterized as “new media”.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In his 1970 “No More Teachers’ Dirty Looks” Nelson says Hyper-media are branching or acting displays that respond to user inputs, such as systems of pre-arranged words and pictures that can be explored freely or queried in stylized ways. Authors, artists, designers, and editors will design, write, draw, and edit them, rather than having them "programmed." They will be media, just like conventional writing and pictures, and because they are "multi-dimensional" in some way, we might name them hyper-media, based on the mathematics term "hyper-."

                    Nelson goes on to give examples of other sorts of hyper-media under the category "Discrete Hypertexts," the first of them can be found. "'Hypertext' refers to kinds of writing that branch or execute on demand; it's best displayed on computer displays," Nelson explains. Hypertexts that are discrete, or chunk style, are made up of individual bits of text that are linked together." In the text, the term "link" appears for the first time.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    What I understand Hypertext to be is a method of linking and accessing multiple types of information as a web of nodes that the user can traverse at their leisure. It's worth noting that Nelson defined hypertext as "types of writing that branch or act on demand." Discrete hypertext relies on links to allow for branching on demand. Instead of using links, Stretchtext creates a non-branching performance. More categories of HyperMedia are listed such as “hypergram” (“a performing or branching picture”), “hypermap” (a smooth zooming interface) and “queriable illustrations” (a type of hypergram). While the behaviors of discrete hypertext and stretchtext differ significantly, they are both "forms of writing." While the examples of hypergrams, hypermaps, and queriable illustrations all involve text, discrete hypertext and stretchtext, in their manner of operation, are textual, that is, writing (even if they include pictorial material).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The reading concludes by welcoming the different meanings of hypertext stating that a definition of hypertext must be followed with context. Individuals in the literary community must review hypertext definitions that emphasize the link, and those in hypertext research must examine definitions that prioritize knowledge work over media.

                <strong class="p-name">What is a browser? How do they work?</strong>
                <p>
                    "An internet browser, also known as a web browser or simply a browser, is a software program that lets you view web pages on your computer." (Sandra Grauschopf,2022). In more specific terms, a browser is a software application that is used to search, retrieve, and display information from the World Wide Web. The information can be in the form of images, web pages, videos, and other files that are connected via hyperlinks and classified using URLs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Examples of the most common browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer, just to name a few.
                </p>
                  <p>
                    The following is a brief history of web browsers:  
                  </p>
                  <li>
                     In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, created the first browser called World Wide Web, which was subsequently renamed Nexus to avoid confusion with the actual World Wide Web. It was a rudimentary, text-based platform with a tiny audience since it was nearly unreachable to anyone who did not have technological skills
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Mosaic, the first Web browser with a graphical user interface, was introduced in 1993.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The Mosaic team simultaneously created Netscape Navigator, which was meant for residential customers to surf at dial-up modem speeds. Following its first release in 1994, Netscape Navigator soon became the dominant Web browser
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Opera was the subject of a research project that began in 1994. Later, in 1996, it was made public.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Safari, Apple's browser, was released in 2003. It was designed exclusively for Macintosh computers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Mozilla launched Firefox as Netscape Navigator in 2004.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Mobile Safari was introduced in 2007 as an Apple mobile web browser.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Google Chrome, the popular browser, was released in 2008.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      In 2011, the fast-growing mobile-based browser Opera Mini was introduced.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      And in 2015, Microsoft released the Edge browser.
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Early web browsers, such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, were basic software that displayed HTML, handled form input, and provided bookmark support. Web browser requirements have grown in tandem with the evolution of websites. Browsers nowadays are significantly more sophisticated, supporting numerous forms of HTML (such as XHTML and HTML 5), dynamic JavaScript, and the encryption used by secure websites. Web developers can build highly interactive websites thanks to the capabilities of modern web browsers.
                  </p>
                  <strong>How do they work?</strong>
                  <p> 
                    "The primary function of a web browser is to render HTML, the code used to design or "mark up" webpages." (TechTerms.com, 2014). Web browsers operate in a client/server framework. The client is the browser that runs on the user's device and sends requests to the Web server, whereas the server is the Web server that provides information back to the browser. The browser then analyzes and displays the information on the user's device. When a user types a web address or URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a search box, such as facebook.com, the request is forwarded to domain name servers (DNS). Several routers and switches are used to route all of these requests. A list of system names and their IP addresses is kept on the domain name servers. As a result, when you write something in the browser search box, it is turned into a number that decides which machines will see the search results. In the client-server architecture, the browser plays a role. A browser is a client application that uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to deliver requests to the server in response to user search queries. When the server gets the request, it gathers information about the requested content and returns it to the browser. The browser then translates and shows the information on the user's device. To put it in simple terms, a browser connects with a web server using the HTTP protocol, which requests an HTML file. also, which will be interpreted by the browser and shown on the user's device's screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Web browsers are typically composed of a number of interconnected components. The user interface (UI), which is the level at which the user interacts with the browser, is included. The browser engine is responsible for querying the rendering engine, and the rendering engine is responsible for producing the requested web page—interpreting the HTML or XML documents. Internet security and communication are handled through networking. A JavaScript interpreter is used on a website to interpret and execute JavaScript code. The UI backend is responsible for the creation of widgets such as windows. A persistence layer, also known as data persistence or storage, controls data such as bookmarks, caches, and cookies.

                 <strong class="p-name">The uses of Metadata - what, why and how</strong>
                 <p>
                  <strong class="p-name">What is Metadata?</strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Metadata is a summary and description of your data that is used to classify, organize, label, and interpret data, making sorting and searching for data much easier. Companies cannot handle the massive volumes of data generated and gathered throughout a business without it. They require it in order to comprehend and efficiently deploy information resources to support various business operations and to allow sophisticated analytics.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Metadata is behind-the-scenes information that is utilized everywhere, by every sector, and in a variety of ways. It is widely used in computer systems, social media, websites, software, music services, and online shopping. Metadata can be created manually by selecting what should be included, or it can be generated automatically depending on the data. There are many types of metadata which includes:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Descriptive metadata is information about a resource or a file that is described in detail. It is used to aid in the detection and identification of objects. Title, abstract, author, and keywords are examples of descriptive metadata.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Structural metadata: information on the structure of a data entity. It informs users about the organization of a resource or file. A table of contents is an example of structural metadata. Tables of contents show how pages from different chapters are connected to one another.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Administrative metadata: Technical data that aids in the management of a resource. This might be the date the file was created, the file type, the permissions, and so on. Administrative metadata is also linked to use rights and intellectual property, since it provides information such as who owns a certain item, how it can be used, by whom, and for how long.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Until the 1980s, when libraries transferred their catalog data to digital databases, metadata was employed in library card catalogs. As data and information were increasingly saved digitally in the 2000s, this digital material was characterized using metadata standards. Different disciplines have their own metadata standards (e.g., museum collections, digital audio files, websites, etc.). Describing the contents and context of data or data files improves their use. A web page, for example, may have metadata indicating what software language the page was written in (e.g., HTML), what tools were used to generate it, what subjects the page is about, and where further information about the subject can be found. This metadata can improve the reader's experience and make it simpler for users to discover the web page online.
                 </p>
                 <strong class="p-name">Why is metadata important?</strong>
                 <p>
                  Metadata makes it easier to find important information as well as search for and retrieve resources. Any digital asset that has been tagged with metadata may be automatically connected with other relevant pieces, making it easier to organize and discover. This allows consumers to establish connections that they would not have made otherwise.
                  Metadata are used to assist and promote resource discovery, identification, resource organization, and the exchangeability of the data as well as the resource or resources it represents. Because not all resources are self-descriptive, metadata captures and provides vital contextual facts.
                  
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Data is nothing more than the sum of its metadata. It is what enables us to build a full picture of our data and comprehend it in its entirety. Because metadata is not the real data, it may normally be made public without risk because it does not offer anybody access to the raw data. Knowing summary facts about a web page or video file, for example, is sufficient to grasp what the file is but insufficient to see the entire page or play the entire video.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Metadata on web pages may be quite useful. The metadata includes content descriptions as well as keywords related to the material. Because search engines frequently display this metadata in search results, its correctness and details may impact whether or not a user decides to visit a site. This data is often given in the form of meta tags.
                 </p>
                 <strong class="p-name">How does it work?</strong>
                 <p>
                  When a document, file, or other information asset is updated, including deletion, metadata is produced. Accurate metadata may help extend the life of current data by assisting users in finding new applications for it. Metadata organizes a data object by employing phrases that are connected with that thing. It also allows different things to be detected and linked with comparable objects to assist maximize the utilization of data assets. As previously stated, search engines and browsers decide which online content to show by parsing the metadata tags associated with an HTML document.

                    I would like to believe that my first website was fun to make. The concepts discussed were not too foreign to understand because I could follow the logic and practice of web design. The year before, I was doing coding, so I would say having prior knowledge of coding made the experience a bit easier. However, starting something new comes with its challenges. I believe as time goes on, I will improve in my web designing. The visual aspect of things needs to be improved. It looks basic and doesn’t have the artistic appeal of the websites I was using for inspiration.

                    What I like about this is the use of color and the logo. It's not too much. It makes the user engage with the website even more. I am not too harsh on myself. I know, with time and practice, I can improve my visual communication. Overall, the experience has been kind to me. I understood the logic and practice of web design. I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I’m excited to get started.
